         It is heartening to note that at long last both the Roman Catholic
         and Protestant Churches of Christendom have openly admitted that Jesus
         Christ was not actually born on the 25th of December. It can be recalled
         that for this veracious view on which the Godâ€™s Kingdom Society took her
         stand since her inception, he has been subjected to persecutions of one sort or another.
